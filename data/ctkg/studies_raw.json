Dengue unexposed participants (seronegative for dengue before vaccination) did not receive the third CYD dengue vaccine injection, but were followed for safety up to 6 months after the last injection.\n\nSafety assessments included solicited reactions within 7 or 14 days after each injection, unsolicited adverse events within 28 days after each injection, and serious adverse events during the study period.

This trial will include patients with stable symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at 3 time points: 1) baseline (before dapagliflozin/placebo administration), 2) 30 days after randomization, and, 3) 90 days after randomization. An intermediate clinical visit will be performed one week after study initiation.\n\nPre-and post-treatment evaluations (at baseline, 30 and 90 days) will include clinical assessment, cardiopulmonary exercise stress test, echocardiography, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and quality of life indicators (Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire -MLHFQ).\n\nThe investigators postulate that dapagliflozin 10 mg/day improves short-term functional capacity of patients with symptomatic HFrEF through multifactorial mechanisms, such as diuretic effect and improvement in myocardial energetic efficiency."

        "detailedDescription": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n* Determine the immune response, in terms of the formation of protective antibody titers to influenza, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with split-virus trivalent influenza vaccine.\n* Correlate the formation of protective antibody titers following immunization with the absolute neutrophil counts and absolute lymphocyte counts in these patients at the time of vaccination.\n\nOUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to current treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (consolidation chemotherapy vs maintenance chemotherapy vs off therapy for the past 6 months).\n\nPatients receive split-virus trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly once or twice at 4 weeks apart for 2 doses.\n\nPatients are followed at week 5. Patients receiving 2 doses of vaccine are also followed at week 9.\n\nPROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 175 patients (50 receiving consolidation therapy, 75 receiving maintenance therapy, and 50 off therapy) will be accrued for this study within 2 years."

Preliminary efficacy assessment of DSP107 as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab in third line treatment of colorectal cancer.",

The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and preliminary efficacy of DSP107 monotherapy and combination therapy in a two-part design.\n\nPart 1 will involve DSP107 monotherapy dose escalation in subjects with advanced solid tumors that are not amenable to surgical resection or other approved therapeutic options that have demonstrated clinical benefit. Additional dose finding cohorts will be enrolled to establish a safe dose of DSP107 when given in combination with atezolizumab.\n\nPart 2 will comprise two expansion cohorts:\n\nA) Expansion cohort A consisting of one treatment arm in which subjects will be treated with DSP107 in combination with atezolizumab. This expansion cohort will enroll subjects with non small cell lung cancer who have progressed following no more than 2 lines of prior systemic treatment including treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 targeting agents.\n\nB) Expansion cohort B consisting of two treatment arms in which subjects will be treated either with DSP107 monotherapy or DSP107 in combination with atezolizumab. This expansion cohort will enroll subjects with colorectal cancer who have progressed following two previous lines of therapy."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate if applying a lidocaine topical solution before wounds treatment decreases the pain of the procedure in comparison with placebo solution.",
        "detailedDescription": "The manipulation of the wounds for its treatment is a painful process and there is currently no marketed any topical drug to decrease this suffering.\n\nThe objective of this study is to demonstrate that lidocaine topical solution applied prior to wounds treatment, reduces the pain of the procedure compared to the treatment done after application of placebo solution. In addition, if the process was less painful, the consumption of systemic analgesics would be reduced (or eliminated) and, therefore, also its secondary effects.\n\nIt is a pilot, single-center clinical trial, prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will include 26 patients admitted in Bellvitge University Hospital (HUB) who present painful wound treatments.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical Department of HUB prepares a dilution of lidocaine 0.5% in 20ml disposable syringes and also identical disposable syringes containing 20ml saline solution (process authorized by the Spanish Agency of Medicines and Sanitary Products).\n\nEach patient included will be subject to 6 procedures, randomised according to the sequence of treatment ABABAB or BABABA (\"A\" is lidocaine solution, \"B\" is placebo solution), according to a random list.\n\nAfter a doctor of The Pain Department evaluates and includes the patient into the study, prescribes the treatment and the Pharmaceutical Department provides 3 identical syringes (numbered), for each procedure, to the nurse of the patient. The first syringe will contain always saline solution (this is unknown for the patient and the nurse) doing this, the investigators obtain the basal pain of each procedure. The other two syringes contain the studying solution (lidocaine or saline solution, according the sequence of the random list) but always the same solution in both.\n\nThe doctors of the Pain Department ask the patient about the pain before starting the procedure and determine according the \"Verbal numerical scale\" (VNS) from 0 to 10 points. The nurse, under sterile conditions, will dampen two sterile gauzes with the solution contained in the syringe 1, and will apply on the wound during 10 minutes before starting the treatment. After this time, the nurse starts the treatment of the wound and the doctor asks again about the pain punctuation on the VNS and register it. All this procedure is repeated with the contain of the syringe 2 and register the punctuation. If the procedure is still painful, the nurse applies (following the same procedure) gauzes with the solution contained in the syringe 3 and the doctor register the VNS punctuation. If even this third application, the treatment is still painful, each patient has prescribed a systemic analgesic to be used at this point if necessary (it does not matter which analgesic, the best for each patient, the only condition is that it can not be modified during the period of inclusion into the study, it is, 6 procedures) and the punctuation in the VNS is also registered. Furthermore, during each procedure, the nurse and the doctor, control the appearance of side effects and 7 days after the last procedure, the doctor contacts to the patient for check the clinical safety.\n\nComparing the procedures carried out after lidocaine solution with saline solution, the investigators will evaluate the reduction of pain in the wounds treatment."

The investigators are also looking at the differences between control and intervention communities in modifiable lifestyle risk factors for diabetes, screening rates for diabetes, rates of newly diagnosed cases of diabetes, general diabetes management, and hospital admission rates, as well as the cost effectiveness of CHAP-P.\n\nThe CHAP-P intervention consists of initial and follow-up sessions where trained local volunteers (Barangay Health Workers, or BHWs) take physical measurements (blood pressure, height, weight, waist circumference) and facilitate a diabetes risk survey\u037e based on these findings, they provide education, materials, and referrals to local health resources as needed.\n\nThe participant groups in this evaluation include those that attend CHAP-P sessions, randomly selected community members that provide consent for a survey and HbA1c testing, and community members and BHWs/other Lead Local Organization staff who provide consent for focus groups and interviews."

        "briefSummary": "Myelopathy describes any neurologic deficit related to the spinal cord. Myelopathy is caused by various pathological states of the human spinal cord, including tumors, inflammatory lesions, spinal cord compression and degenerative myelopathy. Clinically, the diagnosis of myelopathy depends on localization of the neurologic finding to the spinal cord, rather than the brain or peripheral nervous system and then to a particular segment of the spinal cord.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an essential role in the diagnosis and follow-up of the lesions of the spinal cord using conventional MRI T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Sometimes a studied spinal cord may appear normal on conventional MRI even though patients have symptoms of myelopathy causing a discrepancy between MRI findings and clinical findings.\n\nDiffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an advanced non-invasive MR imaging technique which assesses the microstructural integrity of nerve fiber tracts.",
        "detailedDescription": "A number of 70 patient with myelopathy included within the study.\n\nDTI is used primarily for assessing white matter of the brain and spinal cord. DTI can depict alterations to the white matter tract and quantify these changes. Disturbances of diffusion (restriction or increase) may be assessed quantitatively by measurements of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), is used to measure diffusive strength. Diffusion anisotropy can be assessed quantitatively by using the fractional anisotropy (FA) parameter, which may be also visualized on fractional anisotropy maps. FA is considered as a marker of white matter integrity.\n\nImage acquisition will be conducted on a 1.5-Tesla MR scanner.\n\nThe imaging will be done throughout the following sequences:\n\n1. Conventional MRI sequences: sagittal T1W, sagittal and axial T2W sequences.\n2. DTI sequence: Single-shot spin-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) and parallel imaging techniques to achieve motion-free and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) DTI.\n\nPost processing:\n\nThe diffusion-tensor imaging data is transferred to an offline workstation utilizing software used for reconstruction of the Diffusion Tensor imaging (DTI) with regions of interest were defined and measured on the ADC and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. diffusion tensor tractogram will be constructed on the acquired data source."

        "briefSummary": "Brest cancer is the most common cancer in women in France with 52.000 new cases diagnosed in 2010 including nearly 6.000 women younger than 40.\n\nThe improvement of the fertility conservation of cancer patients is one of the goals put forward by the french Cancer Plan (Objective 8.1).\n\nThe issue of fertility after a breast cancer is a frequently raised subjects by the concerned couples today. The improvement in prognosis due to therapeutic advances combined with the increasing age of the first pregnancy and in the recomposed couples bring number of young women between 35 and 40 years followed for breast cancer today to raise these questions with their oncologists.\n\nYoung women have a greater risk to develop agressive tumors requiring a mulitimodal treatment whose general and gonadic side effects can be important and permanently impact the reproductive capacity. At the time of diagnosis, almost 50% of these young patients report that they want to consider a later pregnancy but no data are available on the evolution of this wish over time although it is known that anti-cancer treatments have a serious impact on future possibilities of pregnancy(s).\n\nThe sequential chemotherapy regimen prescribed in adjuvant or neo-adjuvant situation includes intercaling agents (antracyclines) and an alkylating agent (cyclophosphamide) partially responsible for subsequent fertility disorders. In addition, a chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea (CAI) occurs in 50 to 80% of women according to the studies, the latter is sometines definitive and sequellar of treatment. However, few data describe the time of recovery of menstrual cycles in women with CAI and subsequent impact of fertility.\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment on the wishes of fertility before and after the management of cancer of the patients in question, on the recovery of menstrual cycles and the quality of sexual life of these patients.\n\nThe investigators hope to improve the pre-therapeutic evaluation of women wishing to implement measures to preserve fertility, to assist women wishing to consider this type of project after cytotoxic treatments and accompany women suffering from a change in self-image that has an impact on their quality of life. These results could help to sensitize the doctors to the difficulties encountered by young women and to improve and/or to strengthen the global and adapted care of these patients.",

        "briefSummary": "Drug therapy for patients suffering from autonomic failure and neurogenic orthostatic hypotension are scarce and not effective. If left untreated, these patients have the highest risk of syncope, falls and fall-related injuries. The proposed study will determine the clinical benefit of a commercially available drug, atomoxetine, to reduce symptoms associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension in patients with autonomic failure.",
        "detailedDescription": "Autonomic failure is a group of rare neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect the autonomic nervous system. These patients develop neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (OH) because of impaired autonomic reflexes that control cardiovascular and neuro-humoral adaptation to upright posture. The treatment of neurogenic OH is challenging; the therapeutic options are scarce, and some patients are refractory to treatment.\n\nAtomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor that increases the availability of norepinephrine in the synapse by blocking its reuptake. Our preliminary data in sixty-five patients with primary autonomic failure and neurogenic OH showed that atomoxetine was more effective than midodrine, standard of care, in improving standing SBP (+7.5 mm Hg). Notably, only atomoxetine and not midodrine induced a significant reduction in OH-related symptoms (lightheadedness and dizziness) compared with placebo. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that prolonged administration of the norepinephrine transporter blocker, atomoxetine, improves OH-related symptoms and OH-impact on daily activities compared with placebo in autonomic failure patients. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 crossover study."

Pressure pain threshold, as a measure of somatosensory function, is a well-applied measurement technique for the pain perception in KOA. The effect of mobilizations on decrease of peripheral and central sensitivity has been proven in KOA. Furthermore, few studies has revealed the effect of conservative therapy as an effective intervention in the increase of pain threshold. However, no study has investigated the effect of these interventions combined till date in KOA, which could give a long-lasting effect in the decrease of sensitization in KOA.\n\nTherefore, the aim of the present study is to investigate the short-term and long-term effect of end-range mobilization in addition to conservative therapy on decrease of pressure pain threshold in KOA."

In a collaborative project between Brazil and USA, the investigators will use a randomized controlled trial approach to leverage the level of evidence of the benefits of basic adult-education as a possible cognitive reserve builder. If successful, the study's findings will be important in shaping policies targeting increasing access to late-life education to reduce dementia risk."

        "briefSummary": "The objective of this study is to investigate benefits of binaural hearing for non-traditional cochlear implant candidates (with Asymmetric Hearing Loss). Asymmetric candidates are patients with severe to profound hearing loss in one ear and better hearing in the other ear. (One ear is deaf and the other ear has better hearing and in most cases uses a hearing aid.) The investigators hypothesize that cochlear implantation of the poorer ear provides a functional increase in word and sentence understanding in quiet or noise, perceived benefit, localization ability, and other measures of auditory performance relative to use of the better hearing ear alone.",
        "detailedDescription": "Multichannel cochlear implants have been highly successful in restoring speech understanding in adults and children who have congenital or acquired bilateral profound or severe-to-profound sensorineural (permanent) hearing loss. As implant technology has continued to develop and post-implant performance of patients has improved, the patient selection criteria has broadened to include patients with less severe hearing loss. Further, results from studies where patients received bilateral cochlear implants have demonstrated not only improved performance but the feasibility of integrating signals from both ears.\n\nIn contrast to persons with bilateral severe-to-profound hearing loss, persons who have only one ear with profound or severe-to-profound hearing loss and the other ear with substantially less hearing loss have not, to date, been considered cochlear implant candidates. This is because it has been assumed they will do well enough with a conventional hearing aid in the better ear. A problem with this assumption is that even with an appropriately fit better ear hearing aid, many of these hearing-impaired individuals still experience significant difficulties in speech understanding in their everyday listening environments, along with significant communication handicaps that interfere with their employment and quality of life.\n\nPrevious studies that have examined the performance of patients who have more symmetrical hearing loss and who wear a cochlear implant on one ear and a power hearing aid on the other ear, have illustrated that the two inputs can be combined and provide binaural hearing benefits. It is hypothesized in this study that patients with an asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss may also receive significant binaural benefit from having a cochlear implant on the poorer ear along with an appropriately fit hearing aid on the better ear. That is, this study examines whether patients with asymmetrical sensorineural hearing loss can utilize both types of input (acoustic to one ear and electric to the other) effectively, and combine them to receive binaural hearing assistance for improving speech understanding, localization ability, and patient satisfaction."

        "briefSummary": "This is a randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Half the patients are randomized to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and half to routine medical care. Included are one hundred and twenty patients aged 18-80 years plus patients with ongoing CPAP scheduled for abdominal surgery at Ume\u00e5 university hospital. The primary outcome is oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) measured on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before surgery. Secondary outcomes include diffusion capacity for carbon-monoxide, vital capacity, FEV1 and carbon-dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before surgery. PaO2 and PaCO2 are recorded from blood gas measurements obtained from the radial artery. Percentage of nocturnal hypoxia defined as the percentage of oxygen saturation during 90% of the second postoperative night. Tolerance to CPAP measured by the number of hours used CPAP. Side effects related to CPAP. All patients are examined with a simplified sleep apnea examination (Noxturnal T3, Res Med) the night before surgery.\n\nPatients in the CPAP treated group are given an auto-CPAP with a minimum pressure of 5 cm and a maximum pressure of 10 cm. They will be treated with CPAP for at least 2 hours immediately after surgery and during the first two postoperative nights. Oxygen is supplied to CPAP if oxygen saturation falls below 90%. Patients in the control group receives standard treatment and supplemental oxygen if oxygen saturation falls below 90%. In a third arm, we will include patients who already are using CPAP at night at home for previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. are instructed to use CPAP for 2 hours immediately after surgery and subsequent nights during hospital stay.",
        "detailedDescription": "Theory Research question: Does nasal CPAP abolish postoperative hypoxia and lung function decline after abdominal surgery?\n\nMethods This is a randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Half of the patients are randomized to CPAP and half to routine medical care. Randomization is generated by a computer program and handled by a person outside the study. Randomization procedure is documented by the contact person and in the patient's study protocol.\n\nInclude are one hundred and twenty patients age 18-80 years old, scheduled for abdominal surgery at Ume\u00e5 university hospital. Excluded are patients with American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) class 2-3 and patients with cognitive impairment or dementia, unable to participate. Patients with ongoing CPAP treatment are not randomized. Instead, they form a separate group with ongoing CPAP after surgery\n\nThe primary outcome is oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) measured on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before surgery.\n\nSecondary outcomes include diffusion capacity for carbon-monoxide, vital capacity, FEV1 and carbon-dioxide partial pressure (PaCO2) on postoperative day 2 compared with the day before surgery.\n\nPaO2 and PaCO2 are recorded from blood gas measurements obtained from the radial artery. Percentage of nocturnal hypoxia defined as the percentage of oxygen saturation during 90% of the second postoperative night. Tolerance to CPAP measured by the number of hours used CPAP. Side effects related to CPAP.\n\nAll patients are examined with a simplified sleep apnea examination (Noxturnal T3, Res Med) the night before surgery.\n\nA need of 35 patients in each arm was estimated to detect a difference in mean (SD) in PaO2 of 1 (1.5) kilo Pascal with a significance of p\\<0.05 and a power of 80%. Due to dropouts, it is estimated a need to include and randomize 120 patients.\n\nPatients in the CPAP treated group are given an auto-CPAP that can increase the pressure during respiratory arrest (AirSense 10 AutoSet, ResMed Inc) including a silicone nasal mask. It is set with a minimum pressure of 5 cm and a maximum pressure of 10 cm during instruction on the day before surgery. Pressure and mask are tested by trained personnel at the Lung section so that both pressure and mask are comfortable and can be tolerated by the patient. Immediately after surgery they will be given CPAP for at least 2 hours immediately after surgery and during the first two postoperative nights. Oxygen is supplied to CPAP if oxygen saturation falls below 90%.\n\nPatients in the control group receive standard treatment and supplemental oxygen if oxygen saturation falls below 90%\n\nIncluded in a third arm are patients who already are using CPAP at night at home for previously diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea. They are instructed to use CPAP for 2 hours immediately after surgery and subsequent nights during hospital stay."

Several organ involvements are typical, including the central nervous system. Formerly published investigations emphasize a mild cognitive impairment affecting attention, memory, and complicated solution tasks. However, these symptoms significantly impact patients' routines and quality of life. The study examined the associations between cognitive impairment and clinical parameters regarding systemic autoimmune diseases.\n\nMethods: General clinical data, some serum biomarkers including CCl-18, YKL-40, COMP, VEGF, Galectin-3, and Pentraxin as well as results of functional, quality of life, and neuropsychological measures, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Digit Span Forward-Backward, the Trail making A, B and the Digit Symbol tests all were administered."

        "briefSummary": "After a stent procedure, it is common practice to prescribe anti-platelet medication to prevent the blood from clotting. The main objective of this study is to determine if there is a better medication strategy to prevent blood from clotting and at the same time minimising the number of complications.\n\nThere are two medication strategies:\n\n* Study group: Dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor combined with aspirin) for 1 month, and then ticagrelor alone for another 23 months OR\n* Control group: Standard treatment, being dual anti-platelet therapy (ticagrelor or clopidogrel combined with aspirin) for 12 months, and then aspirin alone indefinitely",
        "detailedDescription": "The study objective is to determine in all-comers patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) under standardised treatment (including the BioMatrix family of drug-eluting stents and bivalirudin), whether treatment with 1 month of ticagrelor and aspirin followed by 23 months of ticagrelor monotherapy is superior with respect to the composite of all-cause mortality or non-fatal new Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) compared to treatment with 12 months of standard dual anti platelet therapy (DAPT) followed by aspirin monotherapy.\n\nThe study design is an investigator-initiated, prospective randomised, multi-centre, multi-national, open-label trial to be conducted in approximately 60-80 interventional cardiology centres in Europe, North America, South America and Asia-Pacific. Patients will be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to study or reference treatment strategy.\n\nRandomisation will occur at the time of the index procedure prior to PCI. Subjects will be stratified according to centre and according to the clinical presentation (Stable Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) vs. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)).\n\nAll patients will be followed for a period of 2 years."

These samples will be used to evaluate and compare biomarkers of tobacco exposure across Japanese Americans, Whites, and Native Hawaiians and to add to the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) biorepository to develop or assess future biomarkers.",
        "detailedDescription": "This cross-sectional, observational study will primarily recruit smokers from the MEC study. The biological samples from these smokers are being collected since they do not currently exist in the biorepository (e.g. buccal cells). Potential smokers from the three racial groups who meet specific inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. Should recruitment from the MEC sample be insufficient, smokers who meet the criteria will be recruited from the general population. This study will involve one to two home visits where tobacco use and medical history and biological samples will be collected including blood, buccal cells and urine.\n\nApproximately 300 smokers will be recruited from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study or the general population in Hawai'i. 100 participants from each of the three designated ethnic/racial groups: Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans and Non-Hispanic Whites. All participants will be recruited from Hawai'i to reduce variation due to geographical location and maximize ability to recruit the targeted ethnic/racial groups.\n\nThis study will involve one to two home visits where demographics, tobacco use and exposure history, medical history and medication use, questionnaires assessing tobacco dependence, alcohol use, and environmental exposures will be administered. and biological samples will be collected including blood, buccal cells and urine."

        "briefSummary": "Swallow and dual-task are a current issue and there are few studies on this subject. These studies have shown that as a result of dual-task interaction, swallowing is affected by attention and cognitive capacity, and dual-task negatively affects swallowing performance. But, studies include simple cognitive tasks and are not suitable for daily living activities. There is no study that compares all visual, auditory and motor dual tasks during swallowing and considers the effects on liquid, thick and solid foods similar to daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of visual, auditory and motor dual-task on swallowing and chewing function in healthy young adults. As a result of the study, the dual-task that has the most impact on swallowing and chewing function will be determined, and visual, auditory and motor performance changes will be revealed as well as swallowing and chewing functions. It is planned that the results obtained will guide the rehabilitation of swallowing disorder with further studies on dual-task exercises.",
        "detailedDescription": "For many years, swallowing was thought of as a simple, reflexive activity controlled by the brainstem. However, studies on the neural control of swallowing have shown that cortical and subcortical structures of the nervous system are included in the neural control of swallowing, and swallowing consists of the pre-swallow phase, the oral preparatory phase, aoral phase, pharyngeal phase, and esophageal phase. And swallow prosses tarting with the perception of food.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties of the food, environmental factors, and motor, sensory and cognitive factors belonging to a person are effective in the swallowing process. Swallowing is an integral part of our daily life and we perform it together with other functions in our daily life. For example, while watching TV, in meetings, we continue to swallow/eat or drink. Even if we are not aware of swallowing, performing swallow and other functions at the same time. This situation called as \"dual-task\". 2 tasks performed at the same time always result in a decrease in the performance of one.\n\nSwallow and dual-task are a current issue and there are few studies on this subject.These studies have shown that as a result of dual-task interaction, swallowing is affected by attention and cognitive capacity, and dual-task negatively affects swallowing performance.

        "briefSummary": "Death in Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is usually due to cancer or chronic lung failure around 20 years of age. Despite low lymphocyte counts (CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19), IgA and IgG subclass deficiency opportunistic and acute severe respiratory infections are rare. The prevailing wisdom is that an immunoglobulin replacement therapy is not necessary in most of the patients. However no placebo controlled trials have been performed so far. The aim of this trial was to investigate the prevalence of mild and severe respiratory infections and / or chronic cough in classical A-T patients compared to healthy controls.",
        "detailedDescription": "Ataxia telangiectasia is an autosomal recessive multisystem disorder which is characterized by a progressive ataxia, conjunctival telangiectasia, a humoral and cellular immunodeficiency, an increased radiosensitivity and an increased risk for cancer (Boder E, Pediatrics, 1957). Most patients die in their 2nd or 3rd decade of life due to a respiratory failure caused by progressive (interstitial) lung disease or due to malignancies (Schroeder SA, Pediatr Pulmonol, 2010). In 1995 the sequence of the mutated AT gene (ATM) on chromosome 11q22-23 was identified. Main problems besides the progressive neurodegeneration are recurrent infections of upper and lower respiratory tract and a growth retardation and malnutrition. These problems are caused by a mutation in the ATM gene on chromosome 11, which encodes for a protein with several key functions in control of cell cycle and apoptosis (Savitsky K et al., Hum Mol Gen, 1995). Several works already showed that patients with AT have a variable immunodeficiency which is characterized by low lymphocyte counts, a lack of Immunoglobulin A (IgA), Immunoglobulin G subclasses (IgG2 and 4) and specific pneumococcal antibodies (Schubert R, Clin Exp Immunol, 2002). The course of disease is dependent on the AT mutation respectively the residual kinase activity of ATM which is found in about 10% of A-T patients. These patients are described as 'variant ATs\u00b4 and have a better prognosis regarding immunodeficiency, susceptibility to infections and a possible growth retardation and malnutrition (Verhagen M, Hum Mutat, 2012). Despite the evidence for a humoral immunodeficiency a treatment with polyvalent immunoglobulins (IgG) is not practiced in generally. In the 'Clinical Workshop on Ataxia Teleangiectasia\u00b4, that took place in Frankfurt in January 2011, the investigators found out that the percentage of A-T patient, that are supplemented with immunoglobulins was only 10% to 60% depending on the different clinical centres.The Goethe University Childrens Hospital in Frankfurt, the biggest A-T centre in Germany, takes care for more than 40 A-T patients. At the moment about 15% of these patients are treated with immunoglobulins. Some observations show that the progress of the chronic lung disease cannot be prevented the usage of immunoglobulins. By now it\u00b4s not clear in what way patients suffer from an increased susceptibility to infections and if a substitution with immunoglobulins is needed. The aim of this trial is to investigate the incidence, intensity and duration of infections in patients with A-T compared to age matched healthy controls."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of this experimental study is to explore effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy based Virtual Reality Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy based Flash Technique compared to psychoeducation only group through developing one session online protocols. Follow up will be performed one month after the intervention.\n\nAccordingly, 89 people who applied voluntarily were divided into three groups randomly:\n\n1. psychoeducation and Virtual reality therapy\n2. Flash technique\n3. psychoeducation-only.\n\nAll participants were given a set of scales consisting:\n\n1. The Clinical Global Impressions Scale\n2. FAM (Flight Anxiety Modality Questionnaire),\n3. FAS (Flight Anxiety Situations Questionnaire), and\n4. Visual Analogue Flight Anxiety Scale (VAFAS), to assess the level of fear of flying before and one month after the treatment.\n\nThis work was supported by the Research Fund of Ibn Haldun University. Project Name: Online Single Session Virtual Reality Therapy Programme for Fear of Flying. Project Number: 2238.",
        "detailedDescription": "There are several therapy methods that can help individuals to overcome their flying phobia. Although traditional fear of flying exposure approaches is extensively employed, they have substantial limitations. Classical in vivo exposure for flying is not common because it is very expensive and very hard to adapt for every flight condition. Whereas VRET can give uniquely tailored exposure scenarios like air turbulence or weather conditions, in vivo exposure is harder to deliver since the therapist has little control over the scenario (Rothbaum et al., 2006). In the therapy of specific phobias, virtual reality therapy has been the most widely employed and has garnered the most empirical attention (Price et al., 2008).\n\nWhile cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the mainstream in the flight phobia treatment, empirical research on different psychotherapy strategies is similarly useful in the treatment of flight phobia (Triscari et al., 2015). Specific phobia studies on the Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy indicated that EMDR therapy can provide important developments within a restricted variety of sessions (De Jongh et al., 1999). The Flash technique is a new individual or group intervention technique of EMDR that aims to reduce distress and suffering related to traumatic memories quickly (Wong, 2019).\n\nThe purpose of this experimental study is to explore the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy based Virtual Reality Therapy and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy based Flash Technique compared to Psychoeducation only groups through developing one-session protocols.\n\nHypothesis\n\n1. Is VRET-O more effective than the psychoeducation-only group for reducing participants' anxiety and avoidance behavior for fear of flying?\n2. Is FLASH-O more effective than the psychoeducation-only group for reducing participants' anxiety and avoidance behaviour for fear of flying?\n3. Is there any significantly meaningful decrease in post-test scores of participants' anxiety and avoidance behaviour for fear of flying when compared to the pretest scores?\n\nParticipants were blinded to which group they would be in when they started the study via the Google form link. Randomization was performed by two independent investigators according to the order of application. Randomization was performed according to the order of the list in which the participants signed the consent form. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three groups according to the computer-generated number sequence in a 1:1:1 ratio from https://www.randomizer.org/. both study investigators and participants were blinded to the group to which they were assigned. After randomization, each participant was informed in detail about the treatment and waiting process."

The goal of this project is to test the compliance and efficacy of an alternative treatment in the form of yoga available in an online video format. This study will help further the treatment understanding of one of the most common patient clinical presentations, atraumatic anterior knee pain in adolescents. This is a cumbersome patient presentation that is frustrating for both the patient and treating team in that there is no concrete treatment algorithm that works for everyone. Online yoga videos may be more preferred for some patients and allow for higher compliance with home exercises aimed at treating anterior knee pain. With this study, the investigators hope to ensure that the yoga videos provide equal, or more, pain relief and flexibility at the completion of the program.\n\nIt is hypothesized that patients completing the yoga program will have equivalent or greater flexibility, compliance, and pain relief when compared with current treatment recommendations for anterior knee pain.\n\nThis study aims to assess the success of a video-based eight-week home yoga program at improving compliance, increasing flexibility and functionality of knee movements. Compliance will be tracked through recorded access to the specific YouTube videos hosted through the CTPO YouTube Channel. Anterior knee pain patients will be given a link to two yoga videos and will be asked to do them at home, or wherever convenient for 8 weeks, 3-4 times a week."

        "detailedDescription": "Drug resistant hypertension is very common in end stage renal disease treated by dialysis. The prevalence of hypertension has been evaluated to be over 50% and up 80%. In this patient group mortality figures are high because of cardiovascular diseases which are complications of hypertension. Renal nerve denervation is a new intervention to treat hypertension. By applying radiofrequency pulses to the renal arteries, the nerves in the vascular wall (adventitia layer) can be denervated. This causes reduction of renal sympathetic afferent and efferent activity and blood pressure can be decreased. The technique and its efficacy in end stage renal disease has not been systematically studied. There are case reports which have showed promising responses to denervation. In the present study 30 patients over 18 years are planned undergo renal denervation if the medical treatment (three different drugs including diuretics) has failed to decrease blood pressure sufficiently(160/100mmHg). The failure of medical treatment will be documented by ambulatory blood pressure measurements. After renal nerve denervation a two year follow-up of patients with ambulatory blood pressure measurements will be organized. The blood pressures before and after denervation are compared and the quality of life of the patients is evaluated by questionnaires."

        "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND:\n\nThe Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) is an NHLBI-funded cohort study of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke in adults 65 years or older. In the early 1990s, 5888 participants underwent examinations that included traditional risk factors and measures of sub-clinical disease. During follow-up, many exam components were repeated, and CVD events were ascertained. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has extended CHS contract funding (1) to implement a model for a transition from contract-funding to investigator-initiated research and (2) to enhance access to CHS data for future papers and ancillary studies by CHS and non-CHS colleagues. The Events Follow-up Study will provide a foundation for the transition. Current and future papers and ancillary studies using CHS data or stored specimens will have additional power and can be conducted more efficiently if a service events-core continues to collect and adjudicate CVD events and deaths in a standardized fashion.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nStructurally, the primary aims are: (1) to evaluate the incidence rates of and risk factors for CVD in older adults, including comparisons between blacks and whites, men and women, young old and old; (2) the evaluation of prognosis in inception cohorts of older adults with new-onset conditions such as heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation; and (3) the evaluation of associations between risk-factor change and the incidence of subsequent events. Questions of interest include: What are the determinants of the low CHD incidence in women 80 yrs and older? Do older black women also have a low CHD incidence? What are the determinants of CHD, HF, and stroke in adults 80 and older? Are risk factors different between men and women, whites and blacks? Do traditional risk factors and measures of sub-clinical disease continue to be powerful predictors of CHD, HF and stroke in those 80 and older? In this study, the investigators expect to make over 20,000 phone calls to identify 6000 hospitalizations, 1000 deaths, 3000 events for detailed review, and 1500 new events, including 370 CHD, 300 stroke, and 450 HF. These new events represent an increase in the number of CVD events of 29% to 35% in whites and an increase of 40% to 49% in blacks. The data and specimens collected in CHS represent a major national resource for the study of health, aging, and cardiovascular disease in older adults. Additional events follow-up will not only provide the opportunity to address the aims of this study, but also enhance the power of current and future CHS papers and ancillary studies by CHS and non-CHS colleagues."

This is known as the study medicine. Which treatment participants get is decided by chance. Participants chance of getting ziltivekimab or placebo is the same.\n\nZiltivekimab is not yet approved in any country or region in the world. It is a new medicine doctors cannot prescribe.\n\nParticipants will get the study medicine in a pre filled syringe. Participants will need to use the pre filled syringe to inject the study medicine into a skinfold once-monthly.\n\nThe study is expected to last for up to 4 years. Participants will have up to 20 clinic visits. Participants will have blood and urine samples taken at most of the clinic visits.\n\nParticipants will have their heart examined using sound waves (echocardiography) and electrodes (electrocardiogram).\n\nWomen cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or planning to get pregnant during the study period."

        "briefSummary": "This phase II trial evaluates how well transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) works for treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer or lung metastases. TACE is a minimally invasive procedure that involves injecting chemotherapy directly into an artery that supplies blood to tumors, and then blocking off the blood supply to the tumors. Mitomycin (chemotherapy), Lipiodol (drug carrier), and Embospheres (small plastic beads that block off the artery) are injected into the tumor-feeding artery. This traps the chemotherapy inside the tumor and also cuts off the tumor\\&#39;s blood supply. As a result, the tumor is exposed to a high dose of chemotherapy, and is also deprived of nutrients and oxygen. TACE can be effective at controlling or stopping the growth of lung tumors.",

To determine safety and efficacy (local progression free survival) of chemoembolization of lung cancer that is chemorefractory, unresectable, and unablatable.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients receive lung chemoembolization using Lipiodol, mitomycin, and Embospheres. Response to treatment is evaluated on computed tomography (CT) scans."

        "briefSummary": "This research aims to highlight the key roles of the cerebellar and cortical fronto-parietal networks in the coupling of eye movements with visual perception and visuo-spatial attention.",
        "detailedDescription": "The first axe of this research focuses on the role of the cerebellum which has a major contribution to sensorimotor adaptation and more precisely in saccadic adaptation but the nature of this contribution is still debated. A classical assumption stipulates cerebellum has an exclusive action on saccadic burst generator in the brainstem whereas recent data increasingly support the view that cerebellum could also modulates cerebral cortex through a cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. On the other hand, several studies have shown that modification of saccade amplitude by saccadic adaptation leads to a distortion of the visual localization of briefly flashed spatial probes but no study to date has tested, the contribution of the cerebellum in these adaptation-induced mislocalizations. The main objective of this axe is to define the role of the cerebellum not only in saccadic adaptation, but also in mislocalizations which occur after adaptation. Moreover, in testing this assumption, arguments in favour -or in disfavor- of the action of the cerebellum on cortical stages dedicated to visuo-spatial perceptual processing will be provided. Besides, variability of cerebellar lesion (or cerebellar dysfunction) location in patients can lead to different pattern in saccadic adaptation and localization task performances. Identification of dissociations between these two abilities in some patients will define more precisely the role of the cerebellum in the coupling between saccadic adaptation and visuo spatial perception as an oculomotor plasticity territory and / or as a territory underlying the error signal coding generating this type of plasticity.\n\nThis second axe of this research aims to apply basic findings in healthy subject on the coupling between oculomotor plasticity and spatial attention to patients with parietal lesion, in order to evaluate a rehabilitation procedure for neglect patients. Habchi and colleagues showed that the adaptation of reactive saccades in the left hemifield has a boosting effect on attentional performance in the same hemifield. The coupling between these two mechanisms highlighted in healthy subjects can be used as fundamentals in the elaboration of a rehabilitation procedure for attentional disorders in the neglect syndrome. This syndrome is mainly observed after cerebral lesions in the right hemisphere, and is characterized by very disabling cognitive disorders such as an alteration of the spatial representation of left hemi-space and/or left hemi-body. stimulation of sensorimotor plasticity thanks to prismatic adaptation could be used as a rehabilitation procedure for this syndrome. Being another efficient way to stimulate sensorimotor plasticity, the equip believe that saccadic adaptation can also be used as a rehabilitation procedure for neglect patients. Moreover, due to its tight coupling with visual attention, the benefits of saccadic adaptation could be even stronger and longer lasting than the visuo-manual plasticity induced by prismatic adaptation."

        "detailedDescription": "The proposed study is a Phase 1, dose escalation cohort study of 10-1074-LS alone or in combination with 3BNC117-LS, administered intravenously and subcutaneously in HIV uninfected and HIV-1 infected individuals.\n\nStudy participants will be administered a single intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS at 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, single infusions of the combination of 10-1074-LS and 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg, or subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS alone or in combination with 3BNC117-LS, and three subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS in combination with 3BNC117-LS at three dose ratios. The first four groups administered subcutaneous injections of the product(s) will be randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled to assess potential differences in safety and tolerability of the antibody formulation versus the formulation buffer alone. In the dose ratio portion of the study, participants will be randomized into one of three groups, but the products will be administered in an open-label manner. Groups administered intravenous infusions will be enrolled in an open-label manner.\n\nPART A\n\nGroup 1A (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one 1 mL (approximately 150 mg) subcutaneous injection of 10-1074-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nGroup 1B (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one 2 mL (approximately 300 mg) subcutaneous injection of 10-1074-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nGroup 2A (n=3) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 3 mg/kg.\n\nGroup 2B (n=3) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 10 mg/kg.\n\nGroup 2C (n=3) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 30 mg/kg.\n\nGroup 3B (n=3) - HIV-infected individuals (on ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 10 mg/kg.\n\nGroup 3C (n=3) - HIV-infected individuals (on ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS dosed at 30 mg/kg.\n\nPART B\n\nPart B will begin after the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) evaluates available safety data from Part A, as detailed below. The SMC will also review available safety data with 3BNC117-LS administered intravenously collected under protocol YCO-0946 prior to enrollment in Part B of this study. The SMC will also review subcutaneous dosing at approximately 150 mg (1 mL) and 300 mg (2 mL), collected under IND 131873 when available and prior to enrollment in Part B of this study.\n\nGroup 4A (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one 2 mL (approximately 150 mg of each mAb) subcutaneous injection of 10-1074-LS admixed with 3BNC117-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nGroup 4B (n=8) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered two 2 mL (approximately 300 mg of each mAb) subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS admixed with 3BNC117-LS or placebo (formulation buffer), in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nGroup 5 (n=5) - HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS and one intravenous infusion of 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg.\n\nGroup 6 (n=5) - HIV-infected individuals (on ART) will be administered one intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS and one intravenous infusion of 3BNC117-LS, each dosed at 30 mg/kg.\n\nGroup 7 (n=6) HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered three subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS (100 mg) admixed with 3BNC117-LS (200 mg) (2 mL).\n\nGroup 8 (n=6) HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered three subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS (75 mg) admixed with 3BNC117-LS (225 mg) (2 mL).\n\nGroup 9 (n=6) HIV-uninfected individuals will be administered three subcutaneous injections of 10-1074-LS (60 mg) admixed with 3BNC117-LS (240 mg) (2 mL).\n\nFollowing mAb or placebo administration, study participants will return for safety assessments on days 1 and 3, and weeks 1, 2 and 4 following each dose, then bi-monthly or monthly until the end of study follow up.\n\nAll participants will be followed for 48 weeks after last mAb or placebo administration. Serum samples for PK measurements will be collected before and at the end each mAb or placebo administration and at multiple subsequent time points during study follow up.\n\nSamples will also be collected for measurement of HIV-1 plasma RNA levels before 10-1074-LS and 3BNC117-LS infusions and at follow up visits according to protocol."

        "detailedDescription": "Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is a calcineurin inhibitor immunosuppressant. Pimecrolimus inhibits T cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. Pimecrolimus cream, 1% is indicated as second-line therapy for the short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in non-immunocompromised adults and children 2 years of age and older who have failed to respond adequately to other topical prescription treatments, or when those treatments are not advisable. This study is being conducted to evaluate the clinical bioequivalence of sponsor's formulation of Pimecrolimus Cream, 1%, the Test product, and Elidel Cream, 1%, the Reference product. A vehicle control arm is included to demonstrate that the Test and Reference products are active and to establish that the study is sufficiently sensitive to detect differences between products."

        "briefSummary": "Different non-pharmacological techniques, including hypnosis and virtual reality are currently used as complementary tools in the treatment of pain related to burn injury. A new technique called 'virtual reality hypnosis' (VRH) (Patterson et al., 2004), which encompasses a combination of both tools, is regularly used although its actual function remains unknown to this date. With the goal to improve our understanding of VRH combination effects, it is necessary to elaborate randomized and controlled research studies in order to understand their actual function in individual's perception. 100 patients who are treated as outpatients for burn care will be randomly assigned to virtual reality or VRH. Patients will receive one session of one of these techniques during burn dressing change.Physiological parameters will be recorded during dressing change. Participants will fill in a questionnaire evaluating their tendency to be absorbed and dissociated, and another evaluating their level of perceived immersion. Their level of anxiety, pain, fatigue and relaxation will be evaluated before and after the session. A short interview will also be conducted to give participants the opportunity to openly describe their experience."

        "briefSummary": "Gastrointestinal endoscopy is widely acknowledged as the most useful tool for diagnosing and treating gastrointestinal mucosal lesions. It can not only observe the mucosa directly, but also obtain tissue biopsy for pathological diagnosis. Although the importance of gastrointestinal endoscopy has been well understood, there are still a certain proportion of people who are unwilling to undergo it due to the discomfort and anxiety during the procedures. Music is multifunctional, which can alleviate people's depression, anxiety and other negative emotions as well as help to maintain good mental health. Thus, in this study we aim to investigate the role of music listening in gastrointestinal endoscopy in a randomized controlled clinical trial, especially for those patients who plan to undergo therapeutic endoscopic procedures and try to improve the patients' experience.",
        "detailedDescription": "This is a randomized controlled trial to examine the function of music listening in the procedures of gastrointestinal endoscopy. It was previously reported that music listening may exert beneficial effects for patients who undergo gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, most of the studies did not analyze the effects of the specific music type and listening time in diagnostic and therapeutic gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, respectively. This study will test whether the specific music type and listening time before gastrointestinal endoscopy could improve patients' experience of the procedure in a randomized controlled trial. The results may help to optimize the routine clinical practice at present."

        "briefSummary": "The study is a prospective cohort trial utilizing sequential laboratory results from excess serum obtained from hemodialysis patients (acting as their own controls). The objective of this study is to determine the impact of converting from reuse to single use of dialyzers on specific markers of nutrition (pre-albumin) and inflammation (CRP) in hemodialysis patients followed over a period of 6-months after conversion. The Hypothesis is: Comparing values obtained at baseline to values at the end of 6-months after conversion from reuse to single use in the same patients:\n\n1. In patients with baseline CRP \\> 5 mg/L: Mean decrease of 5 mg/L\n2. In patients with baseline CRP \\< 5 mg/L: \\> 95% will remain \\< 5 mg/L\n3. Mean serum pre-albumin levels will increase by at least 3 mg/dL. The study population will be drawn from \\~2,900 patients that are currently undergoing hemodialysis in 48 dialysis units that have been identified as continuing to reuse dialyzers and specifically are using a peracetic acid-based disinfectant (Renalin\u00ae), as of February 1, 2007. These facilities will be scheduled to convert to single use of dialyzers between May and December, 2007. The selection of patients will depend solely on the facility conversion date, on a first-come, first-served basis. All patients within the dialysis facility that provide blood specimen for their routine monthly lab draws will be eligible. The facilities and patients will be enrolled consecutively until the desired sample size of approximately 2,500 patients is reached",
        "detailedDescription": "The proposed project is an ancillary quality improvement study that intends to prospectively track serum markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein or CRP) and nutrition (pre-albumin) at baseline (within 2-months before conversion from reuse to single use of dialyzers) and at the end of a 6-month follow-up period after the conversion, in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The first 2,500 patients from a potential pool of \\~2,900 patients from 48 dialysis units that are scheduled to convert from reuse to single use of dialyzers, will be included in the study. Apart from routine monthly laboratory measurements, the investigators, in collaboration with Spectra Laboratories (central lab) will perform measurements of CRP and pre-albumin on the excess blood (after all the routine blood chemistries have been obtained) from the patients selected to be part of the study cohort. It is anticipated that the nature of this study as a quality improvement project, with no additional burden to the patients since tests will only be performed on excess blood from samples already sent to the laboratory, and the utilization of the information only in aggregate with no identifiable personal health information will allow for this study to proceed without the need for informed consent from each individual patient. It is hypothesized that the survival benefit that has been observed in some epidemiological studies (including the prior experience at Fresenius Medical Care, North America) may be accompanied by and/or the result of, reduced inflammation and/or improvement of nutritional status in patients that are converted from reuse to single use of dialyzers. The study will compare the difference between the values of CRP and pre-albumin separately, at baseline and at the end of 6-months after the conversion. CRP levels are expected to decline while pre-albumin are expected to increase during the follow-up period. Even with a 20% dropout rate, the study is expected to have \\>90% power to detect a change in CRP of \\>3 mg/L and \\>99% power to detect a similar change in pre-albumin. The patients in this study are only a subset of a larger epidemiological study that will examine the impact of converting from reuse to single use of dialyzers on patient survival."

        "briefSummary": "Context. Faciocraniosynostoses present with an insufficient growth of the craniofacial skeleton due to premature fusion of skull and facial sutures. There are prenatal conditions with functional (risk of raised intracranial pressure) and morphological consequences (exorbitism, and impairment of upper respiratory airways), the severity of which justifies an early surgical treatment based on craniofacial osteotomies and osteodistraction techniques.\n\nDistraction techniques were started in our unit eleven years ago, and never ceased to be modified: Recent improvements allowed better correction of exorbitism and therefore reduction of visual risks. But the improvements of the respiratory function remain insufficient. The initial evaluations of the respiratory functions were based on blood oxygenation monitoring, and showed real improvement. But we have routinely screened our patients with complete polysomnography examinations for the past year, and this has always revealed the existence of severe sleep apnea syndromes that we fail to correct completely, although there were slightly improved.\n\nThe aim of this PHRC protocol is :\n\n* the qualitative and quantitative improvement of the respiratory status with a reinforced task force group including the specialists in genuine multidisciplinary approach.\n* A modification of the surgical technique including modifications of the existing distraction devices, an increased number of implanted devices, and maybe a change in the surgical strategy.",
        "detailedDescription": "Study design. This is a monocentric study, the patient being its own control. Due to the extremely low incidence of these conditions, it is foreseen to include twelve patients per year, during two years, which represent 24 patients in total with a minimum follow-up of one year.\n\nEvaluation criteria. The main evaluation criteria are the polysomnography variables (sleep apnea index, characterization of obstructive versus central respiratory events, the oxygenation pattern through the night), which will be performed before and after surgery (6 and 12 months post-op). The secondary criteria are the exorbitism correction analysed with the globe protrusion index and the rate of infections. A multidisciplinary task force group has already been structured in Necker Hospital.\n\nExpected results. We expect to analyze and correct all the sleep apnea syndromes. Many modifications could be made on the distractors, including removal of the activation rods, bioresorbable parts, as well as the modification of the surgical techniques."

        "briefSummary": "Epidermotropic T-cell lymphomas (ETCL), i.e. mycosis fungoides (MF) and its leukemic variant, S\u00e9zary syndrome, are the most frequent subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. MF typically runs an indolent course in its early stages. By contrast, advanced-stage ETCLs share a very bad prognosis: Patients usually show early relapses after chemotherapy, prolonged complete remissions exceptionally occur and quality of life is severely affected. Several publications have reported durable responses following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in advanced-stage ETCLs. This study aims to investigate the role of allogeneic HSCT in treating advanced-stage ETCLs. An observational, prospective, multicenter, controlled study will compare the outcomes of patients who receive reduced-intensity conditioned allogeneic HSCT from a sibling or 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor to those of patients who receive standard of care in patients with advanced-stage ETCL with poor prognostic features, will be performed. Patients are included at the time of donor search irrespective of the results, and compared on a donor versus no donor basis. It is an observational study since no intervention is made except the comparison of outcomes of groups that receive usual care (HSCT if donor available, or not)."

Moreover, a tool suited to the constraints of community medicine seems necessary, given the growth of the prescription of physical activity in primary care.\n\nThe idea behind this new questionnaire is to obtain a score ranging from 0 to 100 that can be calculated through simple mental arithmetic, which is not the case for most existing questionnaires, in particular the IPAQ.",

In order to continue promoting physical activity (PA), it is necessary to have a well-adapted, simple and rapid tool is that allows precise evaluation and monitoring within the general population.\n\nCurrently, the French National Authority for Health (la Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9), through its guide for the promotion, consultation and medical prescription of physical and sports activity for health in adults, updated in July 2022, proposes an estimate of the \"usual level of PA (\u2026) using the two-question Marshall questionnaire (30 seconds)\" or alternatively, \"it can be calculated more precisely with the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ), a 16-question self-administered questionnaire that patients can complete online at www.mangerbouger.fr.\"\n\nThe GPAQ is one of the most widely used questionnaires. While its strength lies in its precision, it is long to complete and score. Therefore, despite being validated by many studies, it is not practical for routine use. In practice, the \"Ricci and Gagnon\" questionnaire is used for the follow-up of patients, using tracking logs. (Sport sant\u00e9 sur ordonnance. Contexte et exemples de mise en oeuvre. Octobre 2017. ONAPS) . This categorizes individuals as inactive, active or very active, and has never been scientifically validated in a study, to the best of our knowledge.\n\nFinally, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) is a test validated both in long and short forms. It allows a precise calculation of the amount of physical activity expressed in MET (metabolic equivalent)/min/week but does not provide information on its distribution throughout the week. Like the GPAQ, with 27 different questions it is also lengthy to complete, making it impractical for routine use. The short version tends to underestimate physical activity levels, and the final score cannot be easily calculated in real time. Nevertheless, this version will be used as a reference.\n\nThe aim of this work is to propose a new questionnaire that is simple for patients to complete, quick to analyse, can be calculated directly by the doctor, and is adapted to the general population, whether for an initial assessment or a follow-up.\n\nMoreover, the prescription of physical activity is usually carried out over short, renewable periods, whereas long-term changes are necessary to achieve significant improvements in morbidity and mortality.\n\nThe developed questionnaire ultimately aims to be useful for monitoring the evolution of physical activity."

In the acupressure group (n=34), compression was applied to the 7th point of the heart meridian (HT7), the 4th point of the large intestine meridian (LI4), the 36th point of the stomach meridian (ST36), and the 6th point of the spleen meridian (SP6). Depending on the preparation and compression time at each point, the session duration of each student lasted an average of 20 minutes. In the sham group (n=34), pressure was applied approximately 1-1.5 cm away from the HT7, LI4, ST36, SP6 points. In the sham group, the acupressure application time lasted for an average of 20 minutes. At the end of the application, after the data collection process was completed, the sham group was taught the correct acupuncture points. Students applied acupressure three times a week for a total of 12 sessions for four weeks. Data were collected before and four weeks after the application in the acupressure and sham acupressure groups."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of the study is to test the efficacy of the Functionnal ElectromyoStimulation (FES) of lower limbs in advanced chronic heart failure. The hypothesis is that FES treatment could improve functional exercise capacity.",
        "detailedDescription": "Advanced Chronic Heart Failure (ACHF) is a severe and frequent disease inducing a strong limitation of exercise capacity and a poor quality of life. Hospitalisation for cardiac decompensation is frequent and could alter their incapacities because of muscular deconditionning. Tradionnal aerobic rehabilitation exercises fighting against this deconditionning are not relevant in these patients because of dyspnea.\n\nIn litterature, Functionnal Electrostimulation (FES) has been tested in stable Chronic Heart Failure (NYHA I to III), far from decompensation. Several authors showed the same improvements than those obtained with conventionnal rehabilitation on aerobic capacities (peak VO2, 6 minutes walking test) and quality of life.\n\nThe originality of this study is to test FES soon after acute heart decompensation in ACHF patients. This type of rehabilitation could represent in the future an alternative to conventionnal rehabilitation until the patients could be able to do aerobic exercise.\n\n60 patients will be randomised between two groups, the firsth receiving FES (treatment group), the second receiving skin electrostimulation in the same place without muscular contraction (Sham group). Patient and evaluator do not know what type of stimulation they have. These treatments spread over six weeks, five days per seven. They are began in rehabilitation unit then continued at home.\n\nThe principal criteria of judgement of FES efficacy is peak VO2 after the protocol. Secondary criteria are distance to the six minutes walking test, muscular strengh of quadriceps, the muscle mass measured by Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), inflamatory dosage (TNF alpha, IL-1, IL-6, CRP), rest value of Muscle sympathetic nerve activity, score to Minnesota questionnaire and fuctionnal independance.\n\nThe attempted results are an significative improvement of aerobic capacity(peak VO2 and six minutes walking test) and the others secondary criteria in FES group compared with Sham group."

        "briefSummary": "Cholera still remains a global public health concern affecting both children and adults, and patients can succumb in quick time if remain untreated. Cholera is a secretory diarrhea and is generally treated with oral or intravenous rehydration therapy to compensate for the fluid loss. However, antimicrobial treatment is given to patients with moderate to severe diarrhea. The consistent emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria is a major concern for the management of infectious diseases including cholera. No antisecretory drug has so far been proven successful. In a phase II clinical trial, the investigators will assess the effectiveness of a novel antisecretory drug VR-AD-1005 for treating cholera. Changes in stool volume and rehydration therapy will be assessed for VR-AD-1005 in comparison with placebo. If successful, this will be a huge advance in managing cholera and other secretory diarrhea. The introduction of the antisecretory drug can minimize the hospital stay and reduce antibiotic use, which in turn can reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistance among pathogens"

To identify misestimations about the risks and benefits of immunotherapy resulting from media hype or other sources and assess if these misestimations persist post-provider conversation about immunotherapy.\n\nII. To qualitatively describe patient reported misunderstandings and to assess patient understanding of technical terms and metaphors used in the immunotherapy conversation.\n\nIII. To identify provider and patient preferences for information to be communicated about immunotherapy.\n\nIV. Develop videos that describe immunotherapy and test their efficacy in improving understanding using pre and post methodology.\n\nOUTLINE:\n\nPatients and their providers undergo observation during a conversation about immunotherapy. Then participate in an interview over 20 minutes. Understanding of educational videos is then tested."

        "briefSummary": "The purpose of the trial is to establish whether adjuvant therapy with lenalidomide + dexamethasone after radiotherapy can improve progression free survival in patients with high risk solitary bone plasmacytoma compared with RT only.",
        "detailedDescription": "Solitary bone plasmacytoma (SBP) is a localised proliferation of malignant plasma cells (PCs) in the skeleton. The annual UK incidence is 0.4/100,000 (lower than multiple myeloma (MM)) with a peak age incidence at 68 years and there are estimated to be about 260 new cases per year in the United Kingdom (UK). The majority of patients with SBP ultimately progress to myeloma and this is likely due to occult disease not detected by conventional staging methods. Standard care for these patients is involved field radiotherapy (IFRT), but despite radical doses, two-thirds develop multiple myeloma at a median of 2 years, more so if there are high risk features.\n\nThe IDRIS Trial is a phase III study where the investigators hope to demonstrate that adjuvant lenalidomide + dexamethasone following IFRT prevents the development of multiple myeloma in patients with high risk solitary bone plasmacytoma. Whilst a proportion of solitary bone plasmacytoma is cured with IFRT, it is clear that the majority will progress to multiple myeloma. The investigators are seeking to prevent this outcome by using adjuvant therapy in this study."

        "briefSummary": "This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of transcatheter microguidewire drilling (TMD) for transseptal left atrial access in patients with abnormal atrial septal morphology.",
        "detailedDescription": "Despite the widespread application and decades of experience, Brockenbrough-needle transseptal puncture still risks cardiac perforations and secondary pericardial effusion/tamponade, especially in patients with abnormal atrial septal morphology. To facilitate atrial septal crossing, different methods and devices have been developed, including radiofrequency energy, excimer laser, SafeSept wire and so on. However, these are still limited by availability and cost, and the advantages might be further offset by the potential risks. In addition, these methods are performed mainly with the linear insertion technique, which might result in less forward-force to penetrate atrial septum and displacement of needle-tip. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a safe, available and low-cost transseptal procedure for these patients.\n\nThrough a Brockenbrough needle, the hard \"back-end\" of the microguidewire (0.014-inch) has the potential to drill through the atrial septum with ease. Compared with a standard linear insertion technique, the penetration might be improved and less force is required with the bidirectional rotation technique, and the related risks might be reduced with the modified TSP due to the thin microguidewire. After the passage of the needle, the soft-end of microguidewire can be introduced into left pulmonary superior vein, which can become a safe rail for the introduction of puncture dilator/sheath.\n\nIn this study, we examined the effectiveness and safety of microguidewire-assisted TSP for patients with complex atrial septum."
